# breast-cancer-classification-using-neural-network

Build a Neural Network for the classification of Breast Cancer.
<br>
The model is trained on Numerical Data.
<br>
The Dataset is used from scikit-learn library as it comes with many built in datasets
<br>
The Model takes Numerical Data ass input and classifies the Cancer into Malilgnant or Benign
